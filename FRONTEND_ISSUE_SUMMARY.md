# Frontend Issue Summary

## Current Status

The frontend has been successfully migrated to the new URLs:
- Backend: https://ai-agent-demo.agileworks.workers.dev (✅ Working)
- Frontend: https://aiagent-demo-cqf.pages.dev (⚠️ Partially working)

## Issue

The frontend loads and renders the HTML, but the JavaScript is not executing properly. The UI shows "Loading AI assistants..." indefinitely.

## What's Working

1. ✅ Backend API is fully functional and returns 3 assistants
2. ✅ CORS headers are properly configured
3. ✅ Frontend builds without errors
4. ✅ Frontend HTML renders correctly
5. ✅ API can be called successfully from browser console

## What's Not Working

1. ❌ Svelte component's `onMount` function doesn't appear to execute
2. ❌ No console.log messages appear from the Svelte component
3. ❌ The loading spinner never disappears

## Debugging Tools Available

### 1. Debug Page
Visit: https://aiagent-demo-cqf.pages.dev/debug.html

This page tests the API directly without SvelteKit and should show:
- Whether basic JavaScript works
- Whether the API can be called from the deployed environment
- Any CORS or security issues

### 2. Test Scripts
- `test-api-call.js` - Node.js script to test API directly
- `test-frontend-api.html` - Local HTML file with comprehensive tests
- `playwright-debug.js` - Automated browser testing with detailed logging
- `playwright-final-test.js` - Focused test on the specific issue

### 3. Browser Testing
Open the browser console at https://aiagent-demo-cqf.pages.dev/ and run:
```javascript
fetch('https://ai-agent-demo.agileworks.workers.dev/api/assistants', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer demo-secret-token' }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

## Suspected Cause

The issue appears to be related to SvelteKit's client-side hydration on Cloudflare Pages. The server-side rendering works (HTML is generated), but the client-side JavaScript isn't initializing properly.

## Next Steps

1. Check https://aiagent-demo-cqf.pages.dev/debug.html to see if basic JavaScript works
2. Look for any errors in the browser console
3. Consider adding compatibility flags for nodejs_compat if needed
4. May need to adjust the SvelteKit adapter configuration

## Quick Fix Attempts

If the debug page works but the main app doesn't:

1. Try clearing browser cache completely
2. Test in incognito mode
3. Try a different browser
4. Check if there are any ad blockers or extensions interfering
