## Assessment

âœ… **No dangling deployments found**

The multiple entries you see are:
1. **Deployment History** - Cloudflare keeps previous deployments for rollback capabilities
2. **Version Control** - Each deployment creates a new version with a unique ID
3. **Not Duplicates** - These are all versions of the same two projects:
   - One Worker: `ai-agent-demo`
   - One Pages project: `aiagent-demo`

## What This Means

- You're only being charged for one Worker and one Pages project
- The deployment history is normal and expected
- No cleanup is necessary - these aren't redundant deployments
- The history allows you to roll back if needed

## If You Want to Clean History

While not necessary, if you want to reduce deployment history:
- For Workers: Old deployments are automatically cleaned up after a retention period
- For Pages: You can delete old deployments via the Cloudflare dashboard

## Recommendation

No action needed. The deployment history is working as designed and doesn't create any issues or extra costs.
