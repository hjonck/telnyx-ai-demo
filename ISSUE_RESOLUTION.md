# Telnyx AI Demo - Issue Resolution

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hydration Issue** - FIXED
- Updated lucide-svelte from v0.468.0 to v0.525.0
- Frontend now hydrates properly on Cloudflare Pages

### 2. **Wrangler Environment Warnings** - FIXED
- Restructured wrangler.toml to use production as default
- Deploy with `--env=""` to avoid warnings

### 3. **Database Connection Issue** - FIXED
- Created and applied migrations to remote D1 database
- Tables now exist and database operations work

### 4. **500 Error Root Cause** - IDENTIFIED
- **Error**: "The requested connection_id (Call Control App ID) is either invalid or does not exist. Only Call Control Apps with valid webhook URL are accepted."
- **Connection ID**: `2737980253619094625`
- **Issue**: This connection ID either:
  - Doesn't exist in the Telnyx account
  - Exists but doesn't have a webhook URL configured
  - Is not a Call Control App type connection

## üìã Next Steps to Complete

### Fix the Telnyx Connection Issue

1. **Log into Telnyx Portal**:
   - Go to https://portal.telnyx.com/
   - Navigate to Call Control > Applications

2. **Create or Update Call Control App**:
   - Create a new Call Control Application
   - Set the webhook URL to: `https://ai-agent-demo.agileworks.workers.dev/api/webhooks/telnyx`
   - Copy the new Application ID

3. **Update the Worker Secret**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx wrangler secret put TELNYX_APP_CONNECTION_ID
   # Paste the new Application ID
   ```

4. **Verify Phone Number**:
   - Ensure `+27600137472` is a valid Telnyx number in your account
   - Or update the code to use a different number you own

## üéØ Summary

The application is **fully functional** except for the Telnyx configuration:

‚úÖ **Frontend**: Works perfectly, no hydration issues
‚úÖ **Backend**: Deployed and processing requests correctly  
‚úÖ **Database**: Created and accepting data
‚úÖ **API Integration**: Assistants load from Telnyx
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for debugging

‚ùå **Telnyx Configuration**: Connection ID needs to be updated with a valid Call Control App ID

Once the Telnyx configuration is fixed, the demo will be fully operational and able to:
- Initiate AI-powered calls
- Handle webhooks for call events
- Record calls and transcripts
- Display call history and details
